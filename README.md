A High-Performance Timing Analysis Tool for VLSI Systems

# Why OpenTimer?

<img align="right" width="30%" src="image/critical_path.jpg">

OpenTimer is a new [static timing analysis (STA)][STA] tool to help IC designers
quickly verify the circuit timing.
It is developed completely from the ground up using *C++17*
to efficiently support parallel and incremental timing. 
Key features are:

+ Industry standard format (.lib, .v, .spef, .sdc) support
+ Graph- and path-based timing analysis
+ Parallel incremental timing for fast timing closure
+ Award-winning tools and golden timers in CAD Contests


# Get Started with OpenTimer

The easiest way to start using OpenTimer is to use *OpenTimer shell*.
OpenTimer shell is a powerful tool for interactive analysis
and the simplest way to learn core functionalities.
[Compile OpenTimer](#compile-opentimer) and launch the shell program `ot-shell`
under the `bin` directory.

```bash
~$ ./bin/ot-shell
  ____              _______              
 / __ \___  ___ ___/_  __(_)_ _  ___ ____
/ /_/ / _ \/ -_) _ \/ / / /  ' \/ -_) __/
\____/ .__/\__/_//_/_/ /_/_/_/_/\__/_/       v2.0.0 (alpha)
    /_/                                     
MIT License: type "license" to see more details.
For help, type "help".

ot> 
```

We have provided a [simple design](./example/simple)
which consists of five gates (one NAND, one NOR, two INV, one FF) and one clock. 
Move to the folder and read this simple design.

<img align="right" src="image/simple_schematic.jpg" width="55%">

```bash
ot> cd example/simple
ot> read_celllib osu018_stdcells.lib
ot> read_verilog simple.v   
ot> read_sdc simple.sdc
```

Report the timing to show the most critical path.

The critical path originates from the primary input `inp1` and 
feed into the data pin `f1:D` of the flip-flop `DFFNEGX1`.

# Compile OpenTimer

## System Requirements

OpenTimer is very self-contained and has very few dependencies.
To compile OpenTimer, you need a [C++17][C++17] compiler. 
We currently support:

+ GNU C++ Compiler v7.3 with -std=c++1z
+ Clang C++ Compiler v6.0 with -std=c++17

In addition, you need a tcl shell interpreter:

+ [tclsh](https://www.tcl.tk/about/language.html) 
(most Unix/Linux/OSX distributions already include tclsh)

OpenTimer has been tested to run well on Linux distributions and MAC OSX.

## Build through CMake

We use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to manage the source and tests.
We recommend using out-of-source build.

```bash
~$ git clone https://github.com/OpenTimer/OpenTimer.git
~$ cd OpenTimer
~$ mkdir build
~$ cd build
~$ cmake ../
~$ make 
```

After successful build, you can find binaries and libraries in the folders `bin` 
and `lib`, respectively.

## Run Tests
OpenTimer uses [Doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest) for unit tests and
[TAU15][TAU15] benchmarks for integration/regression tests. These benchmarks are generated by an 
industry standard timer and are being used by many EDA researchers.

```bash
~$ make test
```

# Design Philosophy

OpenTimer has a unique software architecture to
efficiently enable parallel incremental timing.
We draw two levers on *performance* and *useability*
by grouping each timing operation to one of the three categories,
*builder*, *action*, and *accessor*.

| Type |  Description | Example | Time Complexity |
| -------  |  ----------- |  --- | -- |
| Builder  | create lazy tasks to build an analysis framework | read_celllib, insert_gate, set_slew | O(1) |
| Action   | carry out builder operations to update the timing | update_timing, report_timing, report_slack | Algorithm-dependent |
| Accessors| inspect the timer without changing any internal data structures | dump_timer, dump_slack, dump_net_load | Operation-dependent |

## Builder: OpenTimer Lineage

OpenTimer maintains a lineage graph of *builder* operations 
to create a *task execution plan* (TEP).
A TEP starts with no dependency and keeps adding tasks to the lineage graph
every time you call a builder operation.
It records what transformations need to be executed 
when an action has been called.


![](image/lineage.png)

The above figure shows an example
lineage graph of a sequence of builder operations.
The cyan path is the main lineage line 
with additional tasks attached to enable parallel execution.
OpenTimer use [Cpp-Taskflow][Cpp-Taskflow] to create dependency graphs.

## Action: Update Timing

A TEP is materialized and executed when the timer is requested to perform 
an *action* operation.
Each action operation triggers timing update
from the earliest task to the one that produces the result
of the action call.
Internally, OpenTimer creates task dependency graph to update timing in parallel,
including forward (slew, arrival time) 
and backward (required arrival time) propagations.

![](image/update_timing_simple.png)

The figure above shows the dependency graph (forward in white, backward in cyan) 
to update the timing of the 
[simple](example/simple/simple.v) design.
When an action call finishes, it cleans out the lineage graph
with all timing up-to-date.

## Accessor: Inspect OpenTimer

The *accessor* operations let you inspect the timer status and dump timing information.
All accessor operations are declared as *const methods* in the timer class. 
Calling them promises not to alter any internal members.
For example, you can dump the timing graph into a DOT format and use tools like [GraphViz][GraphViz]
for visualization.

<img align="right" src="image/simple_graph_raw.png" width="70%">

```bash
ot> dump_graph  
digraph TimingGraph {
  "inp1";
  ...  # skip for short
  "f1:CLK" -> "f1:Q";
  "u1:B" -> "u1:Y";
  "u1:A" -> "u1:Y";
}
```

# OpenTimer Shell

OpenTimer shell is a powerful command line tool to perform interactive analysis.
It is also the easiest way to get your first timing report off the ground.
The program `ot-shell` can be found in the folder `bin/` after you 
[Compile OpenTimer](#compile-opentimer).

## Commands

The table below shows a list of commonly used commands.

| Command | type | Arguments | Description | Example |
| ------- | ---- | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| read_celllib | builder | [-min \| -max] file | read the cell library for early and late splits | read_celllib mylib.lib |
| read_verilog | builder | file | read the verilog netlist | read_verilog mynetlist.v |
| read_spef | builder | file | read parasitics in SPEF | read_spef myparasitics.spef |
| read_sdc | builder | file | read a Synopsys Design Constraint file | read_sdc myrule.sdc |
| update_timing | action | none | update the timing | update_timing |
| report_timing | action | [-num_paths k] | report the critical paths | report_timing -num_paths 10 |
| report_tns | action | none | report the total negative slack | report_tns |
| report_wns | action | none | report the worst negative slack | report_wns |
| dump_graph | accessor | [-o file] | dump the timing graph to a DOT format | dump_graph |
| dump_timer | accessor | [-o file] | dump the design statistics | dump_timer |

# Integrate OpenTimer to your Project

There are a number of ways to develop your project on top of OpenTimer.

## Option 1: Add OpenTimer Subproject

The easiest way to build an OpenTimer application is to include it as a subproject
using CMake [add_subdirectory](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_subdirectory.html).
Copy OpenTimer to your project root directory and configure your CMakeLists 
[as follows](doc/CMakeLists-Subproject.template):

```CMake
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.9)                  # CMake minimum version
project(app)                                          # your OpenTimer application
add_subdirectory(OpenTimer)                           # add OpenTimer project
include_directories(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/OpenTimer)  # add OpenTimer include

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)                            # enable c++17
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

find_package(Threads REQUIRED)                        # thread library (pthread)

add_executable(app app.cpp)                           # link to your app.cpp
target_link_libraries(app OpenTimer Threads::Threads stdc++fs)
```

## Option 2: Install OpenTimer 

Our project [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) has defined the required files
to install when you hit `make install`.
The installation paths are `<prefix>/include`, `<prefix>/lib`, and `<prefix>/bin`
for the hpp files, library, and executable where `<prefix>` can be configured 
through the cmake variable [CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.html#variable:CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX).
The following example installs OpenTimer to `/tmp`.

```bash
~$ cd build/
~$ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp
~$ make 
~$ make install
~$ cd /tmp            # install OpenTimer to /tmp
~$ ls
bin/  include/  lib/  # OpenTimer headers, libraries, and binaries
```

To build your application on top of the OpenTimer headers and library,
you need `-std=c++1z` and `-lstdc++fs` flags
to enable C++17 standard and [filesystem](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/fs) libraries.

```bash
~$ g++ app.cpp -std=c++1z -O2 -I include -L lib -lOpenTimer -lpthread -o app.out "-lstdc++fs "
~$ ./app.out
```

# OpenTimer C++ API

The class [Timer](ot/timer/timer.hpp) is the main entry you need to 
call OpenTimer in your project. 
The table below summarizes a list of commonly used methods.

| Method | Type | Argument | Return | Description |
| ------ | ---- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| read_celllib| builder | path, split | self | read the cell library for early and late splits |
| read_verilog| builder | path | self | read a verilog netlist |
| read_spef   | builder | path | self | read parasitics in SPEF |
| read_sdc    | builder | path | self | read a Synopsys Design Constraint file |
| update_timing | action | void | void | update the timing; all timing values are up-to-date upon return |
| tns | action | void | optional of float | update the timing and return the total negative slack if exists |
| wns | action | void | optional of float | update the timing and return the worst negative slack if exists |
| dump_graph | accessor | ostream | void | dump the timing graph in DOT format to an output stream |
| dump_timer | accessor | ostream | void | dump the design statistics to an output stream |


*All public methods are thread-safe* as a result of OpenTimer lineage.
The example below shows an OpenTimer application and the use of builder, action, and accessor API.

```cpp
#include <ot/timer/timer.hpp>                     // top-level header to include

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  
  ot::Timer timer;                                // create a timer instance (thread-safe)
  
  timer.read_celllib("simple.lib", std::nullopt)  // read the library (O(1) builder)
       .read_verilog("simple.v")                  // read the verilog netlist (O(1) builder)
       .read_spef("simple.spef")                  // read the parasitics (O(1) builder)
       .read_sdc("simple.sdc")                    // read the design constraints (O(1) builder)
       .update_timing();                          // update timing (O(1) builder)

  if(auto tns = timer.report_tns(); tns) std::cout << "TNS: " << *tns << '\n';  // (O(N) action)
  if(auto wns = timer.report_wns(); wns) std::cout << "WNS: " << *wns << '\n';  // (O(N) action)
  
  timer.dump_timer(std::cout);                    // dump the timer details (O(1) accessor)
  
  return 0;
}
```
